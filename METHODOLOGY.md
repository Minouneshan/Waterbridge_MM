# Modern Mercantilism Forecasting Methodology

## Executive Summary

This project employs sophisticated quantitative and qualitative analytical methods to generate probabilistic forecasts about the trajectory of "Modern Mercantilism"—the strategic use of state power to reshape global economic relationships. The methodology combines Bayesian belief networks, game-theoretic analysis, econometric modeling, and comprehensive data integration to produce well-calibrated probability assessments for 25 binary forecasts spanning 1-10 year timeframes.

## Core Analytical Framework

### 1. Bayesian Belief Network Architecture
- **Implementation**: `code/bayesian_model.py` - BayesianForecastModel class with 25 interconnected forecasts
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Log-odds updating with interdependency propagation across 4 major causal chains
- **Innovation**: Captures causal relationships between forecasts with weighted evidence integration
- **Validation**: Evidence for one forecast automatically updates probabilities of causally connected forecasts

**Mathematical Specification**:
```
logit(P_updated) = logit(P_initial) + Σ(w_i × E_i)
```
Where P represents probabilities, w_i are credibility weights (0.40-0.90), and E_i are evidence strengths.

**Network Structure**: 25 nodes representing forecasts, connected through 4 primary causal chains:
- Trade-Security Nexus: F1→F25→F12→F3 (tariffs→defense→subsidies→trade decline)  
- Technology Competition: F23→F14→F24→F13 (AI workforce→standards→data localization→semiconductors)
- Financial Fragmentation: F22→F10→F17/F18 (sovereign funds→BRICS→currency dynamics)
- Resource-Climate Weaponization: F16→F4→F20→F21 (mineral controls→grain bans→carbon tariffs→inflation)

### 2. Advanced Econometric Analysis
