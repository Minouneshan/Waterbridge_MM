# Methodology — Modern Mercantilism Forecasting

> *A transparent, reproducible framework that blends Bayesian belief networks, advanced econometrics, and game-theoretic reasoning to quantify the economic consequences of state-led competition.*

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Our methodology produces calibrated probability estimates for **25 binary forecasts** spanning 1–10 years, achieving **100% quantitative model coverage**. The framework integrates:

1. **Bayesian Belief Networks** – to propagate evidence across causally linked forecasts.
2. **Advanced Econometrics** – comprehensive models for all 25 forecasts including linear regression, VAR, Monte Carlo, and logistic approaches.
3. **Strategic Game-Theory** – to capture incentive-driven policy interactions.
4. **Complete Forecast Coverage** – quantitative models implemented for all forecasts F1-F25.
5. **Rigorous Source Weighting** – to combine heterogeneous evidence streams with traceable credibility scores.

**Key Achievement:** This represents the first complete quantitative implementation, with econometric models backing every forecast from trade restructuring (F1-F7) through systemic risks (F21-F25).

## 2. Core Analytical Framework
### 2.1 Bayesian Belief Network
* **Implementation:** `code/bayesian_model.py` (simple framework) and `code/advanced_bayesian_model.py` (pgmpy-based)
* **Nodes:** 25 forecasts organised into causal clusters with directed edges representing dependencies.
* **Update Rule:**
$$\text{logit}(P_{\text{updated}}) = \text{logit}(P_{\text{prior}}) + \sum_i w_i E_i$$
with $w_i \in [0.40, 0.90]$ reflecting source credibility and $E_i$ the signed evidence strength.
* **Libraries:** NetworkX for visualization, pgmpy for advanced belief propagation (when available).

### 2.2 Econometric Toolkit
* **Implementation:** `code/advanced_models.py`, `code/statistical_tests.py`, and `code/remaining_forecasts.py`
* **Core Models (F1-F7):** Linear regression for trade share dynamics, exponential growth for Vietnam imports, Monte Carlo for trade-GDP decoupling.
* **Extended Models (F8-F25):** Energy gap analysis, demographic transition modeling, conflict escalation models, AI governance fragmentation analysis.
* **Advanced Techniques:** Vector Autoregression (VAR) for FX dynamics, logistic regression for policy adoption, structural break testing.
* Structural-break testing (Chow tests) identifies regime shifts (e.g., 2018 tariff wave).
* Granger causality tests for directional relationships validation.
* **Libraries:** statsmodels, scikit-learn, arch (for advanced econometric tests).

### 2.3 Game-Theoretic Modules
* **Industrial Subsidy Game:** N-player Nash equilibrium modelling subsidy escalation.
* **Technology Standards Race:** Network-effects model for competing ecosystems (5G/6G, AI, semiconductors).
* **Currency Competition:** Payoff matrix for reserve-currency fragmentation versus inertia.

## 3. Data Architecture & Evidence Weighting

### 3.1 Comprehensive Data Sources
Our enhanced framework integrates data from multiple tiers of sources, ensuring robust evidence foundation:

| Tier | Typical Sources | Credibility Weight | Coverage |
|------|-----------------|--------------------|----------|
| **1** | IMF WEO, WTO Profiles, ECB, U.S. Census FT-900 | **0.90** | Core trade/finance |
| **2** | OECD, World Bank, BIS, UN agencies, WHO | **0.80** | Macro/demographics |
| **3** | Think tanks, industry reports, academic studies | **0.70** | Specialized domains |

### 3.2 Enhanced Model-Specific Data Integration
* **Trade Models (F1-F7):** WTO tariff profiles, bilateral trade flows, Census Bureau monthly data
* **Energy/Climate (F8, F19-F20):** IEA renewable capacity, UNEP climate finance, FAO price indices  
* **Geopolitical (F11-F13):** V-Dem democracy indices, ACLED conflict data, OECD migration statistics
* **Technology/Space (F14, F21-F22):** Semiconductor industry data, AI governance assessments, defense spending
* **Systemic Risks (F23-F25):** WHO health expenditure, urban adaptation investment tracking, food volatility metrics

*Cross-Source Verification, Temporal Decay (−5 % per year), and Conflict-of-Interest screening guard against bias.*
